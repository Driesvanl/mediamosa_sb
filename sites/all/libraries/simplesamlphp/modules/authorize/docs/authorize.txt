This module provides an user authorization filter based on regular expressions for those applications that do not cleanly separate authentication from authorization and set some default permissions for authenticated users.


`authorize:Authorize`
: Authorize certain users based on regular expressions.


`authorize:Authorize`
---------------------

For each attribute you can specify a regular expression string or array of strings. If one of those attributes matches (OR operator) one of the regular expression, the user is authorized successfully.

You must use the preg_match format, i.e. you have to enclose it with a delimiter that does not appear inside the regex (e.g. slash (/), at sign (@), number sign (#) or underscore (`_`)).

The users not authorized will be shown a 403 Forbidden page.

Problems:

 * Once you get the forbidden page, you can't logout at the IdP directly,
   (as far as I know), you have to close the browser.


To use this filter configure it in `config/config.php`:

	'authproc.sp' => array(
		60 => array(
			'class' => 'authorize:Authorize',
			'uid'   =>  array(
				'/.*@example.com/',
				'/(user1|user2|user3)@example.edu/',
			),
			'schacUserStatus' => '@urn:mace:terena.org:userStatus:' .
				'example.org:service:active.*@',
	)
