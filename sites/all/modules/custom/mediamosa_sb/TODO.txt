TODO list
---------

Just a list so we know what still needs to be done in the future.

MediaMosa-SB:

- Test if default profile can be found for status page.
- upload/edit asset etc roles->access in menu hook.
- Add setting for collapsed state of metadata fieldsets in upload steps.
- Metadata form must be build using the metadata description taken from
  mediamosa_ck::get_metadata_fields().
- All urls should be able to be prefixed by a setting.
- Need to check if inherit ACL is on mediafiles.

MediaMosa-CK Views;
- Caching needs development. Caching should be off for now.
- Fields like created/changed need a filter class for searching on dates.
