GIT instructions
================

Clone Sitebuilder as normal from github using any of the provided

Sitebuilder uses 2 submodules (MediaMosa SDK and CK), you must include
them to get it working:

$ cd mediamosa_sb/
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Sitebuilder will not work without the submodules.


System Requirements
===================

The minimal requirements are:

Disk space: 15 Megabytes

  The sitebuilder stores small caches of images on it's own site, so
  as the number of assets increase, so will the required disk space.

Database server: MySQL (or MariaDB) 5.0.15 or higher with PDO.

PHP: Drupal 7: 5.2.5 or higher (5.3 recommended)
